# LC-BodyScrollLocker
Lock or unlock your body scroll.

## Why I make another wheel?
I have already try a lot of way to lock body scroll. Includes belows:

1. Set document and body height 100%.
2. Prevent scroll and touch event.
...

But none of these work good to me. Finally, I find a best way to achieve.
If you want to know the detail, please go to see the source code.
